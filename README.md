# ReactNativeProject_InstagramLikeApp3

Make an Instagram App (Part Three)
In this project, we are going to set up a navigational structure for our Woofstagram app. You’ll need to combine everything you’ve learned from the navigation lesson, from programmatic navigation to nested navigators.

We will go over a couple of things, including:

Setting up React Navigation
Creating a stack navigator for our sign in and sign up screens
Creating a tab navigator for the main navigation
Using programmatic navigation to go to the main navigation
